# TESTOR
A methodology to convert scene descriptions into a storyboard. To do so we integrate several
models and dataset to convert a textual scene description into an editing sequence, a concatenation
of shots to represent the scene. The different models, datasets and scripts used to convert the
scene description into a storyboard will be gradually loaded here by November 15 2024.
